# React Project: Two Boxes Demo

This is a simple React project demonstrating responsive design and event handling using React.js.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a webpage displaying two boxes side by side. The layout adjusts responsively, stacking the boxes vertically when viewed on narrow viewports like mobile devices. Additionally, an interactive feature is implemented where clicking on either box triggers a JavaScript alert displaying the message "I am an alert box."

## Technical Details

- **Project Initialization**: The project is initialized using `create-react-app` for quick setup.
- **Styling**: Minimal CSS is used to style the boxes. Alternatively, you can use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components for styling.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout is responsive, tested on both desktop and mobile viewport sizes to ensure proper functionality.
- **Event Handling**: An event handler is implemented to trigger an alert when either box is clicked.
- **Code Quality**: The project follows best practices for project structure, naming conventions, and code quality to ensure readability and maintainability.
